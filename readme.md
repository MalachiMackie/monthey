Small library to calculate how many mon(th)ey days in a month(ey)

Figures out how many of a given weekday during each month eg How many fridays for the next 3 months

Optionally can go from a given date eg. 10th to the 9th inclusive.

I get paid monthly, not on the 1st, and so the number of rent/grocery days changes per month.
